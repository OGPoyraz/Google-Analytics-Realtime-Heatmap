# Google-Analytics-Realtime-Heatmap

This repo uses Google Analytics Realtime API & Google Maps API to demonstrate a realtime heatmap.

I used React for no really-good-reason. You dont need to know React to build a-like-project.

### About ActiveUsersOnMap Custom Component

You can get more information about [Google Analytics Custom Components](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/custom-components) from here. 

The key component is highly inspired from [here](https://github.com/googleanalytics/ga-dev-tools/blob/master/src/javascript/embed-api/components/active-users.js).
