# Google-Analytics-Realtime-Heatmap

This repo uses Google Analytics Realtime API & Google Maps API to demonstrate a realtime heatmap.

I used Webpack-Babel-React but you dont need them actually.

-Google Maps JavaScript API
-Google Maps Embed API

You can check their own website for more information.

### About ActiveUsersOnMap Custom Component

More information about [Google Analytics Custom Components](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/custom-components) from here. 

The key component is highly inspired from [here](https://github.com/googleanalytics/ga-dev-tools/blob/master/src/javascript/embed-api/components/active-users.js).
