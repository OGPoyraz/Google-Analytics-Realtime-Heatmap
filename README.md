### Google API's I used

If you want to build your own project you should use your own API keys. For keeping it simply I'm using the following Google API's

* Analytics API
* Google Maps JavaScript API
* Google Maps Embed API
* Google Realtime API

You can check their own website for more information.

### About ActiveUsersOnMap Custom Component

More information about [Google Analytics Custom Components](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/custom-components) from here. 

The key component is highly inspired from [here](https://github.com/googleanalytics/ga-dev-tools/blob/master/src/javascript/embed-api/components/active-users.js).
